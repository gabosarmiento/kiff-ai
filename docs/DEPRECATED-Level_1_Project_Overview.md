# Level 1: Kiff AI - Project Overview

## Vision
Kiff AI is an Adaptive Application Generation Platform that transforms natural language requests into complete, production-ready applications with integrated knowledge management and multi-tenant SaaS architecture.

## Mission
Build a comprehensive AI-powered platform that combines intelligent application generation with curated API knowledge management, enabling rapid development of domain-specific applications through natural language interfaces.

## Core Features

- ü§ñ **AI Application Generation**: Natural language to complete Python applications via `/api/kiff/process-request`
- üìö **API Gallery**: Curated collection of high-value API documentation with CRUD management
- üß† **Knowledge Management**: LanceDB-powered vectorized knowledge base with semantic search
- üê≥ **Docker Integration**: Automatic containerization with generated Dockerfiles
- üë§ **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Scalable SaaS platform with tenant isolation
- üì± **Modern UI**: Responsive React + TypeScript interface with mobile-first design
- üîß **AGNO Framework**: Julia BFF patterns for intelligent agent orchestration

## Current Status - PRODUCTION SYSTEM OPERATIONAL! üéâ

- AGNO-powered agents using Julia BFF patterns with `agent.arun()` async execution
- File generation and storage in `generated_apps/` directory
- Frontend integration with proper UI feedback and error handling

**‚úÖ API Gallery System**: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Complete CRUD API at `/api/gallery/*` endpoints
- Curated high-value API collection (AGNO, Stability AI, ElevenLabs, Leonardo, etc.)
- Category and priority-based organization with search and filtering
- Frontend management UI with real-time updates

**‚úÖ Knowledge Management**: **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- Backend knowledge endpoints at `/api/knowledge/*`
- Julia BFF Knowledge Engine with LanceDB vectorization
- Semantic search across vectorized documentation
- Real-time knowledge extraction and indexing workflows
- Frontend knowledge browsing with VS Code-style interface

**‚úÖ Responsive UI System**: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Mobile-first responsive design with 3-column desktop layout
- Bottom navigation for mobile, sidebar navigation for desktop
- Knowledge panel integration with "IN USE" vs "RECOMMENDED" APIs
- Modal system for mobile interactions
- Clean component architecture with proper TypeScript

**üéØ Current Priority**: **SYSTEM POLISH & OPTIMIZATION**
- Fix remaining application loading issues
- Clean test data from database
- Performance optimization and mobile testing
- End-to-end workflow validation
