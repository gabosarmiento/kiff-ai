# Terraform AWS Deployment Status

## Current Infrastructure Status âœ…

Successfully deployed AWS infrastructure using Terraform with the following resources:

### Completed Resources:
- **ECR Repository**: `929018226542.dkr.ecr.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/kiff-ai-backend`
- **PostgreSQL Database**: RDS instance with encrypted storage (db.t3.micro)
- **Redis Cache**: ElastiCache replication group (cache.t3.micro)  
- **VPC & Networking**: Complete setup with subnets and security groups
- **IAM Roles**: Configured for ECR access

### Docker Image Status âœ…
- Built minimal FastAPI image for initial deployment
- Successfully pushed to ECR: `929018226542.dkr.ecr.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/kiff-ai-backend:latest`
- Image contains basic health endpoints at `/health` and `/`

## Pending Tasks:

### 1. App Runner Service Subscription ðŸ”„
**Issue**: AWS account requires App Runner service subscription acceptance
**Error**: `The AWS Access Key Id needs a subscription for the service`

**Solution**: 
- Go to AWS Console â†’ App Runner
- Accept service terms (one-time setup)
- Then run: `terraform apply -target=aws_apprunner_service.kiff_ai_backend -auto-approve`

### 2. Current Terraform Commands:
```bash
# From terraform directory:
cd /Users/caroco/Gabo-Dev/kiff-ai/terraform

# Deploy App Runner after subscription:
terraform apply -target=aws_apprunner_service.kiff_ai_backend -auto-approve

# Get outputs:
terraform output
```

### 3. Infrastructure Outputs:
```
ECR Repository: 929018226542.dkr.ecr.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/kiff-ai-backend
Region: eu-west-3
Database: PostgreSQL (encrypted, 20GB)
Redis: ElastiCache (encrypted at rest)
VPC: Complete networking setup
```

## Next Steps After App Runner Subscription:

1. **Complete App Runner deployment** 
2. **Get backend URL** from terraform outputs
3. **Update frontend environment** with backend URL in Vercel
4. **Deploy full backend** (replace minimal image with complete application)

## Infrastructure Configuration:

All AWS resources are configured in `/terraform/`:
- `main.tf` - Main infrastructure definitions
- `variables.tf` - Variable definitions  
- `outputs.tf` - Output configurations
- `terraform.tfvars` - Your API keys and secrets (configured)

## Costs:
- **Database**: db.t3.micro (~$13/month)
- **Redis**: cache.t3.micro (~$15/month)  
- **App Runner**: 0.25 vCPU, 0.5GB memory (pay-per-use)
- **VPC**: Standard networking costs

## Security:
- All sensitive data stored securely in terraform.tfvars
- Database and Redis encrypted
- VPC isolation with security groups
- Environment variables properly configured

## Manual Alternative:
If App Runner subscription continues to be an issue, you can:
1. Use ECS Fargate instead (modify Terraform)
2. Deploy to Railway/Render as backup
3. Use EC2 with Auto Scaling Group

The infrastructure foundation is solid and ready for deployment once App Runner subscription is resolved.
