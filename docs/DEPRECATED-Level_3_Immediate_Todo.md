### üéØ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Production Polish & Bug Fixes

#### 1. Critical Bug Fixes (CURRENT FOCUS - HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Applications Loading Issue**: Fix file content loading for generated apps
  - Issue: ApplicationsPage.tsx shows "Loading files..." instead of actual file content
  - Backend: Returns proper file content via `/api/kiff/applications/{app_id}/files`
  - Frontend: Loading state gets stuck, needs debugging in file loading workflow
  - Location: `frontend/src/pages/ApplicationsPage.tsx:line_range_to_debug`
  - Priority: HIGH - Blocks user ability to view generated applications

- [ ] **Database Cleanup**: Remove remaining test applications and fake data
  - Issue: ~15 test applications still in database from development
  - Action: Clean slate needed for production-ready user experience
  - Command: SQL cleanup or admin interface purge
  - Priority: HIGH - Affects new user onboarding experience

- [ ] **Knowledge Selection Integration**: Ensure knowledge affects app generation
  - Issue: Verify that selected knowledge bases improve generation quality
  - Test: Generate same app with/without knowledge selection
  - Validate: Knowledge context appears in generated applications
  - Priority: MEDIUM - Core feature validation

#### 2. System Integration & Testing (NEXT - HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] **End-to-End Workflow Validation**
  - Complete flow: Request ‚Üí Knowledge Selection ‚Üí App Generation ‚Üí File Preview
  - Test with multiple API domains (AGNO, Stripe, Leonardo, Stable Diffusion)
  - Validate knowledge selection improves app quality and API integration
  - Ensure Applications page displays real file content with syntax highlighting

- [ ] **Mobile Experience Testing**
  - Test all modal interactions on actual mobile devices
  - Validate bottom navigation and hamburger menu functionality
  - Test knowledge panel modal behavior on small screens
  - Optimize touch interactions and swipe gestures

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Fix application file loading performance (backend query optimization)
  - Optimize knowledge search and selection responsiveness
  - Improve initial page load times across all components
  - Implement proper loading skeletons instead of generic spinners

#### 3. Production Readiness (NEXT - MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Error Handling & User Feedback**
  - Add proper error boundaries for React components
  - Implement comprehensive error messages for failed operations
  - Add retry mechanisms for transient failures
  - Improve loading states with descriptive messages

- [ ] **Documentation & Deployment**
  - Update README.md with current system architecture
  - Create deployment checklist for Vercel production
  - Document environment variables and configuration
  - Create user onboarding documentation
